In my Machine Learning class, we built a model to generate text based on Jane Austen's novels. I wanted to see how well my model would work for other types of writers, so I grabbed the `Text Only Transcript` column, meshed it together, and fed it into the model. You can find it [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NhWDJKKcKeX75TTkNDy_Bl1A0GCaAZx-?authuser=1#scrollTo=fSUghgUFc6ba).

## The First 1000 Characters

present time & felt that we continued to the appearance of the stage of the 
sixter work of God that the whole articles in the

## How it's Made
There's a lot of formatting stuff in here left over from how this text is output on the main website. In the future I might remove those, but I was curious how the model would tackle this strange syntax. Here's a sample entry:
<br><br>
September 21, 1845 ~ Sunday

21st Sunday I spent the day at home with
my family through the day & evening. Mrs :â
Woodruff was more composed concerning the
death of her [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Mother]] & slep comfortible during
the night we had both dreamed of loosing
teath which is generally a sign of a death
of some friend
<br><br>
September 22, 1845 ~ Monday
<br><br>
22nd [FIGURES] I recieved thre letters & wrote 4
I recieved A Pamphlet from Glasgow
Scotland writting written by [[T. S. Barr|T. S. Barr]] A Priest
denying the attonement or Blood of Christ
As being necessary for the redempton of man
I wrote letters in reply 4 


## Accuracy
Obviously this generation isn't very interesting as a text, but as a representation of the real journals it's fairly accurate. All of the people referenced are real people in his life, and they all appear in his journals. “Doctrin” and “ownly” are also real misspellings from his journals, so it not only caught his grammar but also his personal spellings. <br><br>
However, there are some errors. "Sixter" isn't in the dictionary or in his journals, and December 10, 1844 was a Tuesday, not a Saturday.

## Specifications
My model is built from 3 Gated Recurrent Units, that will save previous letters and take them into consideration to choose the next letter and words. I ran 26 epochs, each running for about 11 minutes per epoch.
